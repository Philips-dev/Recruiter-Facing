# BuddyBot – Rule-Based Conversational Assistant (Python)

BuddyBot is a simple, rule-based conversational assistant built in Python.  
This project was created to understand how conversational logic, intent detection, and basic AI behavior can be implemented using fundamental programming concepts before moving on to machine-learning-based systems.

## 🔹 About the Project

BuddyBot simulates a friendly chat companion using:
- String processing
- Conditional logic (`if-elif`)
- Input normalization
- Simple conversational design

The goal of this project is **learning by building**, not creating a production-ready AI.

This project is inspired by conversational AI systems like ChatGPT, but implemented in a simplified, transparent, and beginner-friendly way.

## 🔹 Features

- Friendly greeting and conversational responses
- Handles common user intents such as:
  - Greetings
  - Exam stress
  - Motivation
  - Coding mindset
  - Focus and productivity
- Case-insensitive input handling
- Clean exit mechanism (`bye`)
- Console-based interaction

## 🔹 How It Works

BuddyBot follows a **rule-based AI approach**:
1. Takes user input
2. Normalizes text (lowercase)
3. Matches keywords using conditional logic
4. Returns appropriate responses

This approach mirrors early AI systems and game NPC logic.
