# Linux System Monitor (C)

## Problem
Understanding how operating systems expose process and resource information to users.

## Solution
A lightweight Linux system utility written in C that monitors basic system metrics such as CPU and memory usage using system-level interfaces.

## Features
- Displays system resource usage
- Uses low-level Linux system information
- Minimal and efficient design

## How to Run
Instructions will be added once implementation is complete.

## What I Learned
- Basics of Linux system interfaces
- Writing clean and modular C code
- Translating OS concepts into practical tools
